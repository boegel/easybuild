**framework**

* make ``--try-X`` command line options work recursively (i.e. collaborate with ``--robot``) (`#922 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/922>`_)

  * EasyBuild will first build a full dependency graph of the specified easyconfigs, and then apply the ``--try`` specifications

    * the elements of the dependency graph for the used toolchain and its dependencies are left untouched

  * this makes ``eb foo-1.0-goolf-1.4.10.eb --try-toolchain=ictce,5.5.0 --robot`` also work when ``foo`` has dependencies
  * caveat: the specified easyconfig files must all use the same toolchain (version)

* add support for testing easyconfig pull requests from EasyBuild command line (`#920 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/920>`_, `#924 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/924>`_, `#925 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/925>`_, `#932 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/932>`_, `#933 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/933>`_, `#938 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/938>`_)

  * add ``--upload-test-report`` command line option for uploading a detailed test report to GitHub as a gist

    * this requires specifying a GitHub username for which a GitHub token is available, using ``--github-user``
    * with ``--dump-test-report``, the test report can simply be dumped to file rather than being uploaded to GitHub
    * see also https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/Review-process-for-contributions#testing-result

* the ``makeopts`` and ``premakeopts`` easyconfig parameter are deprecated, and replaced by ``buildopts`` and ``prebuildopts`` (`#918 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/918>`_)

  * both ``makeopts`` and ``premakeopts`` will still be honored in future EasyBuild v1.x versions, but should no longer be used

* various other enhancements, including:

  * fix unit test for ``--skip`` (`#929 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/929>`_)
  * make sure ``start_dir`` can be set based on location of unpacked first source file (`#931 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/931>`_)
  * the ``vsc`` package shipped with easybuild-framework is synced with vsc-base v1.9.1 (`#935 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/935>`_)

    * fancylogger (used for logging in EasyBuild) is now robust against strings containing UTF8 characters
    * the ``deprecated`` logging function now does a non-strict version check (rather than an erroneous strict check)
    * the ``easybuild.tools.agithub`` module is removed, ``vsc.utils.rest`` now provides the required functionality

  * fix support for unpacking gzipped source files, don't unpack ``.gz`` files in-place in the source directory (`#936 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/936>`_)

------------------------------------

bugfix release

**framework**

* fix regular expression used for obtaining list of modules from ``module avail`` (`#724 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/724>`_)

  * modules marked as default were being hidden from EasyBuild, causing problems when they are used as dependency

EasyBuild v1.8.0 (October 4th 2013)
-----------------------------------

feature + bugfix release

**framework**

* add support for using alternative module naming schemes (`#679 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/679>`_, `#696 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/696>`_, `#705 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/705>`_, `#706 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/706>`_, `#707 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/707>`_)

  * see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/Using-a-custom-module-naming-scheme for documentation
  * module naming scheme classes that derive from the 'abstract' ``ModuleNamingScheme`` class can be provided to EasyBuild

    * the Python module providing the class must be available in the ``easybuild.tools.module_naming_scheme`` namespace
    * a function named ``det_full_module_name`` must be implemented, that determines the module name in the form of an string based on the supplied dictionary(-like) argument

  * the active module naming scheme is determined by EasyBuild configuration option ``--module-naming-scheme``
  * for now, only the ``name``/``version``/``versionsuffix``/``toolchain`` easyconfig parameters are guaranteed to be provided

    * consistently providing all easyconfig parameters (i.e., also for dependencies) requires more work (see `#687 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/687>`_)

  * implementing this involved a number of intrusive changes:

    * the API of the modules.py module needed to be changed, breaking backward compatibility

      * the function for which the signatures were modified are considered to be internal to the framework,
        so this should have very minor impact w.r.t. easyblocks not included with EasyBuild
      * affected functions include: ``available``, ``exists``, ``show``, ``modulefile_path``, ``dependencies_for``

    * the format for specifying dependencies was extended, to allow for specifying a custom toolchain

      * this allows to fix inaccurate dependency specifications,
        for example: ``('OpenMPI', '1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2')" to "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4', '', ('GCC', '4.7.2'))``
      * see also `easyconfigs#431 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/431>`_

    * the recommended version for Lmod was bumped to v5.1.5

      * using earlier 5.x version still works, but may be very slow when 'available' is used, due to bugs and a missing
        feature in Lmod versions prior to v5.1.5 on which we rely

* various other enhancements, including:

  * only (try to) change group id if it is different from what is wanted (`#685 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/685>`_)
  * added toy build unit test (`#688 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/688>`_)
  * support for specifying a list of source paths in EasyBuild configuration (`#690 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/690>`_, `#702 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/702>`_)
  * add function to determine CPU clock speed in ``systemtools.py`` (`#694 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/694>`_, `#699 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/699>`_)

* various bug fixes, including:

  * avoid importing toolchain modules over and over again to make toolchain constants available in toolchain module (`#679 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/679>`)
  * only change the group id if current gid is different from what we want in ``adjust_permissions`` function (`#685 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/685>`)
  * restore original environment after running 'module purge' (`#698 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/698>`)

    * important sidenote: this results in resetting the entire environment, and has impact on the sanity check step;
    * any environment variables that are set before the EasyBlock.sanity_check_step method fires, are no longer there when the sanity check commands are run (cfr. `easyblocks#268 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/268>`_)

**easyblocks**

* added **one** new `generic` easyblock: ``BinariesTarball`` (`#255 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/255>`_)
* added support for **5** new software packages that require customized support:

  * DB (`#226 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/226>`_), FDTD Solutions (`#239 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/239>`_), FoldX (`#256 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/256>`_), Mathematica (`#240 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/240>`_), MUMPS (`#262 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/262>`_)

  * stop using deprecated ``add_module`` function in imkl easyblock (`#250 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/250>`_)
  * fixed PSI easyblock w.r.t. support for building plugins (`#254 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/254>`_, `#269 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/269>`_)
  * move OS check for Clang to ``check_readiness_step``, to allow a build job to be submitted from SL5 (`#263 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/263>`_, `#264 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/264>`_)
  * enable verbose build for DOLFIN, to allow for proper debugging if the build fails (`#265 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/265>`_)
  * make sure ``$LDFLAGS`` and ``$INSTANT_*_DIR`` env vars are set for DOLFIN sanity check commands (`#268 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/268>`_)

    *  this is required after resetting the environment after running module purge (see framework release notes)

  * don't try to load module in LAPACK test-only build (`#264 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/264>`_, `#266 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/266>`_)

  * define a proper module class in `all` easyconfigs, cfr. default module classes defined in framework (`#150 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/150>`_, `#159 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/159>`_, `#161 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/161>`_, `#162 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/162>`_, `#179 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/179>`_, `#181 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/181>`_)
  * extend FFTW easyconfig to 'fat' builds that include single, double, long double and quad precision libraries in the same module

    * quad precision is disabled for Intel compiler based builds (it requires GCC v4.6+)

  * the imkl easyconfigs used for the ictce 3.2.2.u3 toolchain now also enable FFTW interfaces

* various 'bug' fixes, including:

  * fix filename for Mercurial and ROOT easyconfig files
  * fix homepage/description for Hypre
  * fix enabling OpenMP support in OpenMPI: use ``--enable-openmp``, not ``--with-openmp``
  * use correct configure flag for enabling OpenMPI threading support in v1.6 (`#186 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/186>`_)

    * ``--enable-mpi-thread-multiple`` instead of ``--enable-mpi-threads``

  * explicitly add ``--without-openib --without-udapl`` configure options in OpenMPI easyconfig using versionsuffix ``-no-OFED`` (`#168 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/168>`_)

    * this avoids that OpenMPI auto-detects that it can enable Infiniband (OpenIB) support, which doesn't fit the -no-OFED versionsuffix
    * Note: this makes goalf-1.1.0-no-OFED effectively not suitable to produce software builds that are IB-capable!

  * remove explicit ``--with-udapl`` from OpenMPI easyconfigs, does more harm than good (`#178 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/178>`_)
  * remove libibvers, libibmad, libibumad as explicit dependencies for OpenMPI/MVAPICH2 (`#173 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/173>`_, `#182 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/182>`_)

    * leave it up to the OS to provide these, since the required version is too much tied to the version of IB drivers

  * use ``license_file`` in Intel tools easyconfigs, as opposed to the new generic ``license`` parameter with a different meaning (`#180 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/180>`_)
  * modify patch for impi to avoid installation problems due to hardcoded path in /tmp (`#185 <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/185>`_)

    * now uses ``$USER-$RANDOM`` subdir to avoid clashes between different users on the same system

  * the patch file for numpy was extended to also supporting ATLAS and other BLAS libraries spread across multiple directories

    * the extension for ATLAS is required because we now no longer rely on the automatic numpy mechanism to find the ATLAS libs

  * fixed dependencies:

    * libibumad as dependency for libibmad
    * ncurses as dependency for libreadline
    * ncurses and zlib as dependency for SAMtools (+ enhanced patch)
    * remove explicit FFTW dependency for Meep, ... since toolchain already provided FFTW
